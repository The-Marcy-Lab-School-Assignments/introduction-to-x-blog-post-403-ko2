# To Create or not to Create, A Game Dev Endevor. 

By Jose Correa


## Genesis
Last week I set out to start my biggest project to date and I encountered a major issue. I have experience with web development and I decided that I wanted to learn something new. Game Development! But the problem was - game development... What is game dev? What even is a game engine for real? It sounds cool... How do I even start? It wasn't long before my autodidact instincts kicked in and I began researching, reading up on what I could. That was me a week ago and now that I have a better grasp on the topic. The point of this blog will be to share the knowledge i've accumulated thus far as well as show where I am in my own build process for my core project. If you're a beginner on their first "Hello World" I hope to educate and inspire you to give this a try. If you're a seasoned game dev, you can see how a fellow programmer can learn and leverage your art into something of their own! And as for the answer to the last question I had posed. You can start right here with me!

## What is a game engine
To put it simply, a game engine is a powerful framework that streamlines the process of developing video games. Think of it like this: imagine you created a grade automation program for a school, and now you're making a similar one for another school. You wouldn’t want to build the whole thing from scratch again — you'd reuse your existing system to save time and effort.

Game engines work the same way. Instead of creating all the core systems from the ground up, developers use pre-built engines to focus on the unique parts of their game — like mechanics, story, or visuals.

Game engines come with different built-in features, but most include a suite of tools and systems to support game development, such as:

* Graphics/Rendering engine

* Physics engine

* Audio engine

* Input handling

* Animation system

* Scripting system (e.g., Python, C#, Java)

* Asset management (e.g., sprites, models, sounds)

* And more!

## Creating vs Re-Using
There are 3 main reasons to create a new engine,
* You want to learn: The best way to learn anything is to do the work. Make it yourself, tinker, break things, fix them. Research and make your own custom engine. It can even be a clone of an already existing one, but the key take away is - you know how it works from the inside out because you made it yourself.
* Necessity: There are plenty of games out there that run custom engines. Noita (https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/) for example: In this game, every pixel is able to fall in the custom built - ###everything falls engine. This isnt availible in engines on the market so the developers had to make a custom engine to implement this feature!  

## Your favorite game is no stranger

* For programming languages: What are the key differences between the new language and JavaScript? What are the commonalities?
* For frameworks (including React and Express): What are the alternatives to this framework? Can you compare this framework to anything we've learned in the Core Curriculum? What are the tradeoffs when choosing this framework compared to the alternatives?

## How you can learn fast

## My personal project

* Wrap things up
* Provide links to resources that you used to help you learn the language.

## Here is an example!
