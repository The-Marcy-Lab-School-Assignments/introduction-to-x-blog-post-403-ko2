## What is a game engine
The driving factor of innovation in the gaming industry in the last 20 years has been through the use of game engines. But what exactly is a game engine? If you're a programmer, you can think of a game engine as a large framework that you can build a game around to decrease the time it takes to create your game. If you're a car guy, think of a game engine as a literal engine, if you pair it with the right chassis and parts you can create an amazing vehicle.  
* Why should someone learn the language/framework that you are learning?
* What is it used for? How popular is it? Who is it for (developers or users)?
* Incorporate real-world analogies when appropriate and useful.

## Core syntax/features.Â 

* For programming languages: data types, variables, code blocks, functions, conditionals, arrays and objects, and iteration. Include code snippets with explanations.

* For frameworks (including React and Express): setup/installation/configurations, core concepts, key methods or approaches. Include code snippets with explanations.

## Compare and Contrast

* For programming languages: What are the key differences between the new language and JavaScript? What are the commonalities?
* For frameworks (including React and Express): What are the alternatives to this framework? Can you compare this framework to anything we've learned in the Core Curriculum? What are the tradeoffs when choosing this framework compared to the alternatives?

## Conclusion & Tips for learning this language/framework.

* Wrap things up
* Provide links to resources that you used to help you learn the language.
