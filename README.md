# To Create or not to Create, A Game Dev Endevor. 

By Jose Correa


## Genesis
Last week I set out to start my biggest project to date and I encountered a major issue. I have experience with web development and I decided that I wanted to learn something new. Game Development! But the problem was - game development... What is game dev? What even is a game engine for real? It sounds cool... How do I even start? It wasn't long before my autodidact instincts kicked in and I began researching, reading up on what I could. That was me a week ago and now that I have a better grasp on the topic. The point of this blog will be to share the knowledge i've accumulated thus far as well as show where I am in my own build process for my core project. If you're a beginner on their first "Hello World" I hope to educate and inspire you to give this a try. If you're a seasoned game dev, you can see how a fellow programmer can learn and leverage your art into something new! And as for the answer to the last question I had posed. You can start right here with me!  

What we aim to cover in this blog:
* [What is a game engine?](#What is a game engine)
* [How to choose your engine.](#Choose your character!)
* [What games use what engine.](#Your favorite game is no stanger)
* [My personal goal with a game engine](#What about me you ask?)
* [How to learn what you need](#The learning process)
* [Making snake.](example)
* [References and people](My inspirations)


## What is a game engine
The driving factor of innovation in the gaming industry in the last 20 years has been through the use of game engines. 
* Why should someone learn the language/framework that you are learning?
* What is it used for? How popular is it? Who is it for (developers or users)?
* Incorporate real-world analogies when appropriate and useful.

## Core syntax/features.Â 

* For programming languages: data types, variables, code blocks, functions, conditionals, arrays and objects, and iteration. Include code snippets with explanations.

* For frameworks (including React and Express): setup/installation/configurations, core concepts, key methods or approaches. Include code snippets with explanations.

## Compare and Contrast

* For programming languages: What are the key differences between the new language and JavaScript? What are the commonalities?
* For frameworks (including React and Express): What are the alternatives to this framework? Can you compare this framework to anything we've learned in the Core Curriculum? What are the tradeoffs when choosing this framework compared to the alternatives?

## Conclusion & Tips for learning this language/framework.

* Wrap things up
* Provide links to resources that you used to help you learn the language.
